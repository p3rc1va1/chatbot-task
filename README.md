1) Required python libraries:
   flask, flask_cors, openai, dotenv, os

2) To use your own api key, you need to create your own .env file in the same directory and just type:
   KEY = "YOUR OPENAI API KEY"

3) After ensuring first two steps are done, just run the backend python file. After it starts the flask server succesfully it will show you the link
   to the server. Copy that link, find the PASTE_YOUR_LINK_HERE variable in the js code, change the link there and just open the html in your preferred browser.
